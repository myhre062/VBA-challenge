## Module 2 Challenge

This repository is dedicated to a homework assignment where VBA scripting is utilized to analyze generated stock market data. The primary goal is to loop through all stocks for a given year and extract the information, such as ticker symbol, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume.

Please refer to the Stock_Data.bas and Stock_Data.txt files in my repository for grading. 

## Instructions

Clone the repository and create a new module in the excel sheets in the Resources file. In these modules you can copy and paste the vba scripts provided in the Stock_Data.bas or Stock_Data.txt. Click the play button and watch the VBA program do it's work. This may take a few seconds.

Note: Ensure that macros are enabled in Excel to run the VBA script.

## Summary

The script efficiently performs the stock market data analysis for multiple worksheets, providing a comprehensive summary of the data. The comments in the code explain how the VBA code works.
